# CSCI 499-01  

Hey guys, I am going to give the basic guideline on how to set up the project. It is important we do it properly so we don't run into issues later. Hopefully, everone has already cloned the project and thus, is using git to track any new developments. The first thing to do is set up a virtual enivorment. You should be in the root directory for the following commands:
'''bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
